A snake like using three different graphic libraries (SFML, NCurses, Allegro).

This was one of the most interesting project in Epitech. This was about coding a snake-like, using the principle of shared librairies.

We used the SFML, NCurses and allegro to make a snake , with lots of bonus, music, and  growing difficulties using the strategy design pattern.
